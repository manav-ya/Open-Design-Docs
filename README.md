# Open Design Docs

A community-maintained collection of reusable design documentation, templates, patterns, and examples that teams can copy, adapt, and contribute to.

Status: Active — contributions welcome

Purpose

- Make design decisions, research, and artifacts discoverable and reusable across projects and teams.
- Provide clear, lightweight templates and examples that can be adapted to different processes and organizations.
- Document patterns and accessibility considerations so design knowledge is easy to share.

Repository structure

- templates/ — Reusable document templates (PRD, RFC, research, design critique, etc.)
- patterns/ — Design patterns, component behavior, and interaction notes
- guidelines/ — Writing, review, and contribution guidance
- examples/ — Completed example documents and case studies
- assets/ — Images, diagrams, and media used by docs

If a folder listed here is missing, add it as needed — this repository is intentionally flexible.

Getting started

1. Browse templates to find a starting point that fits your workflow.
2. Copy a template into your project, or adapt it directly in this repository.
3. Follow the guidelines in guidelines/GUIDELINES.md (or CONTRIBUTING.md if present).
4. When contributing, explain context, trade-offs, and decisions so others can reuse your work.

How to contribute

We welcome contributors across design, product, engineering, and research.

- Fork the repo and create a branch named feature/<short-description> or fix/<short-description>.
- Add or update files (use kebab-case for filenames where possible).
- Commit with clear messages and open a pull request explaining the change and rationale.
- Link related issues and request appropriate reviewers.

If you're proposing a major change, open an issue first to discuss the approach.

Document conventions

- Use Markdown for all documents.
- Start with a short summary and a status (Draft / Proposed / Final).
- Include Context, Problem Statement, Goals, Alternatives, Decision/Outcome, Consequences, and References where relevant.
- Cite sources and link related issues/PRs.

Accessibility & inclusivity

Prioritize accessibility and inclusive language in all documents. Add accessibility notes to component and pattern docs.
